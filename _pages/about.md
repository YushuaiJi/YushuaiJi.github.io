I am Yushuai Ji, a third-year Ph.D. student at Wuhan University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Sheng Wang](http://sheng.whu.edu.cn/) and Prof. Zhiyong Peng in the Totem Database Lab. I am also grateful to collaborate with other excellent researchers, including Prof. [Zhifeng Bao](https://baozhifeng.net), Dr. [Shixun Huang](https://shixunh.io/), Dr. [Yuan Sun](https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/y6sun), and Dr. [Zhiyu Chen](https://zhiyuchen.com/). My research interests include vector databases (e.g., approximate nearest neighbor search and clustering-based indexing), clustering theory (e.g., balanced k-means for high-dimensional data), and machine learning for databases (e.g., learned indexes and index selection). In the future, I plan to explore the applications of clustering algorithms and query techniques in large language models, with a particular focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
